The structure of most blogs are similar, with a homepage that lists all the blog posts, and each blog post having its own page. The homepage is usually paginated, with a fixed number of posts per page. Otherwise, we don't need to worry about pagination and we can recursively scrape all the blog posts based on the structure of the blog.
